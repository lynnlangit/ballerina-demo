// Event streams and stream processing example!
// An 'event' is any occurrence that happens at a
// clearly defined time and is recorded in a collection of
// fields. 'Stream' is a constant flow of data events.

// Record type that represents the stock update event.
type StockUpdate {string symbol;float price;};
// Record results that represents the events that are produced after stream processing.
type Result {string symbol;int count;float average;};

// This stream receives and publishes incoming events.

// specify the event processing logic and producing result
// to the output stream.

    // is published to this stream.

    // 'forever' clause consumes a stream of events and then
    // processes them in motion across a time window.

    // Within a time window of 3s, select the stock
    // quote events in which the stock price is larger than
    // 1000. Count the number of stock quotes that are
    // received during the time window for a given symbol and
    // calculate the average price of all such stock quotes.
    // The result is published to the resultStream, which
    // triggers the function handlers for that stream.
